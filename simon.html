    <h1>Simon Slays</h1>
    <h3>The color version of the Simon Says game is a fast-paced memory challenge of lights and sounds. It is different from the children's game of the same name and is most famously known as the electronic handheld game, Simon.
<br>
GAMEPLAY:
<br>
The game consists of four colored pads, typically pink, blue, green, and yellow, with each color producing a distinct tone.
<br>
A round begins with the device flashing up one of the colors.
<br>
The user must then repeat this single-color sequence by pressing the corresponding colored pad.
<br>
With each successful repetition, the game adds another color to the end of the sequence, making the pattern longer and more complex.
<br>
If the user presses the wrong color or takes too long to repeat the sequence, the game ends.
<br>
The goal is to repeat the longest possible sequence of colors and sounds to achieve a high score.</h3>
